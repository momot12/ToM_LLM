Sam: Yeah but it’s her birthday tomorrow and I can't see her myself, so I'm kind of worried that it’s not going to get there on time. So I really need to send it today but I don't know where to find a store nearby. Helen: Uhm, I think there is one on Chestnut Street, so if you go down to the end of this street and turn left, then it's about half a block down on the left. Sam: Thanks! Helen: No problem. Here’s Sam again. Later Sam meets his friend Pete. Sam: Hi Pete, how are you? Pete: Oh hi Sam how are you? Sam: Yeah, I'm OK. Pete: You don't sound so happy. What's up? Sam: Oh, I'm just a bit annoyed. I was really hoping to send a card to my granny, so I was looking for a store where they would sell post stamps. So I asked Helen, you know her, right? She is in our class. Pete: Yeah, I know Helen! Sam: Well, I asked Helen where I could buy post stamps. She told me there was a store on Chestnut Street. But when I got there, there was a big sign on the door saying it had moved to Bold Street. So I raced over to Bold Street, but I didn't make it on time, the store was already closed. Pete: No way! Sam: Yeah. So now my granny won't get her birthday card on time and I know she'll be really disappointed. Sam: Hey, I've heard that Helen is a bit of a joker. Do you think she would send me to the wrong place on purpose? Pete: Well, did she know how important it was to send the card today? Sam: Yeah I told her it was for granny's birthday tomorrow. Pete: Then I think she probably wouldn't have been deliberately trying to trick you. It was probably an honest mistake.;Pete: I thought Helen didn't know that the store had moved. Is this correct?;Yes;;;;

Are you settling in OK? Sam: Yeah I'm gradually finding my way around, thanks. Hey, you don't happen to know where I can find the nearest store to buy some post stamps? I need to send a card to my granny. Helen: Oh, that's sweet of you.

H_3;17;M;1;Meet Hannah. She is late for the lunch break and when she comes in, all the places are taken. Then, she discovers there is a free chair next to Ama and her boyfriend, Matthias. Hannah: Hi guys, I'm late, can I sit here? Ama: Oh actually, I was saving that seat for Abi. Hannah: Oh, okay. Ama: Sorry! Hannah meets Carolyn. Hannah: Hey Carolyn, can I sit here? Carolyn: Sure. Carolyn: Hey are you OK? You look a bit upset. Hannah: Yeah I'm alright, it's just that Ama is so mean sometimes. Carolyn: What happened? Hannah: Well, I came in to lunch a bit late, and there were hardly any seats left, but when I asked if I could sit at the table with her and Matthias and their friends, Ama said she was saving the seat for Abi! Carolyn: So? Ama and Abi always save seats for each other. Hannah: But Abi went home sick this morning! So Ama couldn't have been saving the seat for her. She was just making up an excuse. Hannah: I think the real reason that she didn't want me to sit with them is that she's jealous. She thinks her boyfriend Matthias has a crush on me, but it isn't true! Carolyn: Well, I didn't know that Abi was off sick. I was in a rehearsal all morning, and actually, Ama was there too, so she probably didn't know either that Abi had gone home.

Carolyn: So? Ama and Abi always save seats for each other. Hannah: But Abi went home sick this morning! So Ama couldn't have been saving the seat for her. She was just making up an excuse. Hannah: I think the real reason that she didn't want me to sit with them is that she's jealous. She thinks her boyfriend Matthias has a crush on me, but it isn't true! Carolyn: Well, I didn't know that Abi was off sick. I was in a rehearsal all morning, and actually, Ama was there too, so she probably didn't know either that Abi had gone home. Carolyn: Besides, we sat with her and Matthias at lunch yesterday and that didn't bother her. So I don't think she's jealous of you.;Hannah: I thought Carolyn already knew that Ama knew that I understood that her boyfriend liked me. Is this correct?;No;;;;
H_3;22;M;4;Meet Hannah. She is late for the lunch break and when she comes in, all the places are taken. Then, she discovers there is a free chair next to Ama and her boyfriend, Matthias. Hannah: Hi guys, I'm late, can I sit here? Ama: Oh actually, I was saving that seat for Abi. Hannah: Oh, okay. Ama: Sorry! Hannah meets Carolyn. Hannah: Hey Carolyn, can I sit here? Carolyn: Sure. Carolyn: Hey are you OK? You look a bit upset. Hannah: Yeah I'm alright, it's just that Ama is so mean sometimes. Carolyn: What happened? Hannah: Well, I came in to lunch a bit late, and there were hardly any seats left, but when I asked if I could sit at the table with her and Matthias and their friends, Ama said she was saving the seat for Abi!

I told Hannah that Ama (with whom I was in rehearsal) always kept a seat for Abi, who had apparently gone home sick today. Is this correct?;Yes;;;;
