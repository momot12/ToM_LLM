I need to send a card to my granny. Helen: Oh, that's sweet of you. Sam: Yeah but it’s her birthday tomorrow and I can't see her myself, so I'm kind of worried that it’s not going to get there on time. So I really need to send it today but I don't know where to find a store nearby. Helen: Uhm, I think there is one on Chestnut Street, so if you go down to the end of this street and turn left, then it's about half a block down on the left. Sam: Thanks! Helen: No problem. Here’s Sam again. Later Sam meets his friend Pete. Sam: Hi Pete, how are you? Pete: Oh hi Sam how are you? Sam: Yeah, I'm OK. Pete: You don't sound so happy. What's up?
